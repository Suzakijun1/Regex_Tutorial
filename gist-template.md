# Title (replace with your title)

Regex, short for Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. It is primarily used for pattern matching and manipulating text strings. In a regular expression, characters can represent themselves or serve as metacharacters with special meanings. By combining these characters and metacharacters, you can create complex patterns to match specific strings or patterns within a larger text. Some common uses for regular expressions include: Pattern matching, string manipulation, text parsing, etc.

The following gist will give a thorough description of the central components in matching a given URL utilizing regular expressions in Javascript.

## Summary

The following regex can be used in order to validate a URL.

```
Regex Matching a URL:
/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/
```

The following gist will break down this regex by its components (anchor, quantifies, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, and character escapes). Each section will have a description, symbol, and where the code is located within the regex.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

An anchor is a metacharacter that specifies a position within a string where a match should occur.
Within the Regex, the symbol `^` is the start of the string.

The symbol `$` is the position at the end of the string.

### Quantifiers

`?` matches the receding element zero or one time.
`*` matches the preceding element zero or more times.
`{2,6}` specifies a range for the preceding element (2 to 6 occurrences).

### OR Operator

The main OR operator used in the regex is `[]`.

### Character Classes

`[\da-z\.-]` matches any digit (`\d`), lowercase letter (`a-z`), dot (`.`), or hyphen (`-`).
`[a-z\.]` matches any lowercase letter (`a-z`) or dot (`.`).
`[\/\w \.-]` matches a forward slash (`\/`), any word character (`\w`), space (` `), dot (`.`), or hyphen (`-`).

### Flags

Flags are not used in the pattern.

### Grouping and Capturing

`(` and `)` are used for grouping and capturing subexpressions. In this example, there are four groups:
`(https?:\/\/)?` matches the protocol part of the URL (e.g., `http://` or `https://`). The `?` makes the preceding group optional.
`([\da-z\.-]+)` matches the domain name part of the URL. This group captures one or more digits, lowercase letters, dots, or hyphens.
`\.([a-z\.]{2,6})` match the top-level domain (TLD) part of the URL. This group captures a dot followed by 2 to 6 lowercase letters or dots.
`([\/\w \.-]*)*` matches the path part of the URL. This group captures zero or more occurrences of forward slash, word characters, spaces, dots, or hyphens. The `*` quantifier allows the group to repeat.
`\/?` matches an optional trailing forward slash.

### Bracket Expressions

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

### Back-references

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
